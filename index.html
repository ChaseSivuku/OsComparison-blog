                    Windows uses drive letters to represent storage devices and/ or partitions (C:\ or D:\). The File System Type(s) that are used are NTFS, exFAT and FAT32. User files are usually stored in C:\users\ with sub folders that are for different file types.
                    System files are usually stored in C:\Windows\  and/or C:\Program Files\.
                    For file paths, Windows uses backslashes (\) to separate folders and they are not case sensitive
