            Windows uses drive letters to represent storage devices and/ or
            partitions (C:\ or D:\). The File System Type(s) that are used are
            NTFS, exFAT and FAT32. User files are usually stored in C:\users\
            with sub folders that are for different file types. System files are
            usually stored in C:\Windows\ and/or C:\Program Files\. For file
            paths, Windows uses backslashes (\) to separate folders and they are
            not case sensitive.

            Windows is not case-sensitive, meaning File.txt and file.txt are treated as the same file. 
            However, Windows is case-preserving, so it remembers the original capitalization. You can’t 
            use characters like \ / : * ? " < > | in file or folder names, and you can't name files CON, 
            PRN, AUX, NUL, or COM1 through COM9, as these are reserved system names
          </p>

            <p>
            Windows primarily uses NTFS (New Technology File System) for internal drives. It supports file
            permissions, encryption, compression, and large file sizes. FAT32 and exFAT are also supported, 
            mostly for USB drives and SD cards. FAT (File Allocation Table) is an older system and is still 
            used in very small storage devices or embedded systems like BIOS or digital cameras.

            Linux uses one root for all files. User data is placed in /home/
            directory while system configurations are stored in /etc and
            essential binaries in /bin/usr and/or in sbin/. Drives and
            partitions are mounted manually or automatically under /mnt or
            /media. Linux uses forward slashes(/) and is always case-sensitive.

            Linux is case-sensitive, meaning data.txt, Data.txt, and DATA.TXT are all different files. 
            You can use almost any character in file names except the forward slash / and the null 
            character \0. Spaces are allowed but should be escaped or quoted when used in the terminal 
            (e.g., "My File.txt" or My\ File.txt).

            Linux commonly uses ext4 (Fourth Extended File System) for most distributions. It supports 
            journaling, large volumes, and is very stable. Linux can also work with other file systems like 
            ext3, Btrfs, XFS, and can read/write to FAT32 and exFAT when the right tools or drivers are 
            installed.

            Mac follows a Unix style structure where everything begins from one
            root also. User home folders are stored under /Users. Drives and
            USBs are found under .Volumes and system files are organized in
            directories like /System, /Library and /Applications. Applications
            are stored as .app bundles. Mac also uses forward slashes and case
            sensitive by default. Symbols like (~) are used to represent the
            user’s home.

            By default, macOS is case-insensitive but case-preserving, unless the drive is formatted with 
            a case-sensitive file system. So Report.docx and report.docx are usually the same file. Like 
            Linux, macOS doesn’t allow characters such as : in file names (though / is also restricted 
            when interacting from the terminal). Filenames can include spaces and Unicode characters.

            macOS uses APFS (Apple File System) for modern macOS versions (especially SSDs). It supports 
            snapshots, encryption, and fast directory cloning. Older systems may still use HFS+ (Mac OS 
            Extended). macOS can read and write FAT32 and exFAT drives, making it compatible with 
            Windows-formatted USBs.
